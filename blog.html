                <h4>Local Storage:</h1>
                a)The storage capacity of <code> local storage</code> is 5MB/10MB.
                b)As it is not session-based, it must be deleted via javascript or manually.
            c)There are fewer old browsers that support it.
         <h4>Session Storage:</h4>
              a)The storage capacity of <code> session storage</code> is 5MB.
              b)Itâ€™s session-based and works per window or tab. This means that data is stored only for the duration of a session, i.e., until the browser (or tab) is closed.
              c)There are fewer old browsers that support it.

              <strong>This is the second item's accordion body.</strong> It is hidden by default, until the collapse plugin adds the appropriate classes that we use to style each element. These classes control the overall appearance, as well as the showing and hiding via CSS transitions. You can modify any of this with custom CSS or overriding our default variables. It's also worth noting that just about any HTML can go within the <code>.accordion-body</code>, though the transition does limit overflow.
